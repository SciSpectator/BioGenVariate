BioGenVariate is a sophisticated, GUI-driven Python application designed for in-depth analysis of gene expression multispiecies data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). It provides a multi-step workflow to extract, filter, label, and analyze biological samples, moving beyond simple keyword searches to incorporate advanced semantic filtering, statistical analysis, and ontology-based natural language processing contextualization from sample descriptions.

The suite is engineered for researchers who need to identify relevant sample cohorts, analyze case/control groups, and explore the descriptive metadata associated with unique gene expression patterns. It excels at analyzing regions of interest in gene expression distributions (such as tails or specific bins) and generating insightful visualizations, including word clouds of biologically enriched tokens that are clustered into canonical terms based on ontology names like DOID and Uberon.


# Core Features 🔬

- Intelligent Sample Extraction: Utilizes the entire GEOmetadb.sqlite database, loaded into memory for rapid querying, and applies a two-stage semantic and lexical filtering process to find the most relevant samples.

- Bio-Aware Token Analysis: Leverages a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model to identify statistically enriched and biologically relevant keywords from sample metadata.

- Ontology-Driven Clustering: Maps relevant keywords to the DOID (Human Disease Ontology) and Uberon (multi-species anatomy ontology) to cluster findings into meaningful biological categories.

- Flexible Case-Control Labeling: Supports both fully automatic labeling based on semantic similarity and an interactive manual labeling mode for expert-driven classification.

- Interactive Gene Distribution Explorer: A powerful interface to plot expression distributions, interactively select sample tails or bins, and trigger deep-dive analysis on those subsets.

- Structured & Reproducible Results: Automatically generates a comprehensive results ( set of plots, graphs, and data tables for each analysis ) , saved in a logically structured, timestamped directory.


# Installation & Setup ⚙️

Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+

    PyTorch (with CUDA support recommended for performance)

    Sufficient RAM to load GEOmetadb and GPL expression datasets into memory (>16 GB recommended).

# 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-SciSpectator/BioGenVariate.git

cd BioGenVariate


# 2. Install Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt


The application will also download necessary NLTK data models (punkt, stopwords, wordnet) on first run.

# 3. Required Data Files

GeoExplorer requires several large data files to be placed in specific directories.

    GEOmetadb.sqlite.gz:

        Action: Download from GEOmetadb or another source.

        Location: Place this file in the root directory of the project.

    GPL Expression & Token Data:

        The application expects a directory structure for each platform's data. Create a main data directory (e.g., /home/user/GEOMETADB_TOKENS_PLATFORMS) and update the path in the GeoWorkflowGUI class constructor.

        Inside this directory, create a sub-folder for each platform (e.g., GPL570, GPL96).

        Expression Data: Place the gzipped CSV expression matrix for each platform in its respective folder (e.g., GPL570/gpl570_all_samples_normalized.csv.gz).

        Token Data: Place the pre-computed token file for each platform in its folder (e.g., GPL570/geometadb_tokens_GPL570.csv.gz).

    Fine-tuned Model & Keywords:

        The fine-tuned PubMedBERT model and biomedical keyword corpus are required for the AttentionSeeker functionality.

        Update the self.model_dir and self.keywords_dir paths in the GeoWorkflowGUI class to point to their locations.


# Usage (How to Use BioGenVariate) : 🚀

Once all dependencies are installed and data files are in place, run the main script from the project's root directory:

python geo_workflow_gui.py


The main application window will launch, and you can begin the analysis workflow.

# Tutorial:

Using BioGenVariate is a straightforward process that guides you from a broad research question to specific, actionable insights. The workflow is divided into a few key phases.

# 1.Initial Setup and Sample Extraction

<img width="1468" height="958" alt="gse_extraction2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b91b4b97-b2a9-4c20-9110-91582553ed72" />

<img width="829" height="668" alt="gse_extraction" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f6a139c-8f81-440d-9ac6-44f7d8d5e92d" />


This step helps you find the specific data you need from GEO. In the "GSE Extraction" section, simply fill in the two options:

# Step 1: Find your samples

Platform Filter: Tell BioGenVariate which microarray platform to search, like GPL570.

Filtering Tokens: Type in the keywords for your research topic, like liver,skin,  pancreatic cancer.

After you click "Run GSE Extraction," a new window will pop up showing a table of all matching studies (GSEs). Here, you can review the keywords and sample counts for each study. You then have a choice: you can select only the specific studies you want to analyze further, or you can keep them all. Once you confirm your selection, a CSV file containing all the detailed sample (GSM) information from your chosen studies is automatically saved to the results folder.



# Step 2: Group Your Samples

After finding your data, this step lets you sort the samples into groups, like 'case' vs. 'control'. You have two options:

Automatic Labeling: Choose this if you want the tool to sort the samples for you. It will ask you for keywords that describe your "case" group (e.g., cancer tissue, malignant) and your "control" group (e.g., normal tissue, healthy). The AI will then automatically label each sample.

Manual Labeling: Choose this if you want to sort each sample yourself. A window will pop up for every sample, showing you its details so you can decide whether to label it as "Case," "Control," or "Skip."








# 2. Gene Distribution Explorer

# 3. Compare Distributions

# 4. Generating and Interpreting Results

The true power of BioGenVariate is unlocked when you analyze a region of interest from the gene expression plot. Simply clicking "Analyze LEFT Tail" or "Analyze RIGHT Tail" triggers a powerful backend cascade. The application automatically identifies statistically enriched tokens in the metadata of those specific samples, filters them for biological relevance, and clusters them using disease and tissue ontologies. This process generates a suite of visualizations, including a powerful Canonical Word Cloud where terms are colored by their ontological category (e.g., red for disease, green for tissue), providing an immediate, contextualized overview of the biological themes that define your sample set. All plots and detailed statistical tables are automatically saved to the NEW_RESULTS_ROOT directory for your records.




# Workflow Overview: 📊 

  Load GPL Datasets: Use the buttons in the UI to load the desired platform expression datasets into memory.

  Run Step 1 (GSE Extraction): Enter filter tokens (e.g., "cancer,tumor") and platform IDs (e.g., "GPL570") and click "Run GSE Extraction".

  Review & Select GSEs: A dialog will appear summarizing the extracted GEO Series (GSEs). Select the series you wish to analyze further.

  Run Step 2 (Labeling): Choose either "Automatic" or "Manual" labeling to classify the samples from the selected GSEs into case/control groups.

  Analyze in Gene Explorer: Launch the "Gene Distribution Explorer", select genes and platforms, and click "Plot Distributions". From there, you can interactively analyze tails or bins to generate word clouds, cluster graphs, and statistical reports.
